Now those companies have formalized their complaints in a letter addressed to the European Commission, where they collectively argue that Apple has made a mockery of the new law and urge the EC to take \u201cswift, timely, and decisive action against Apple\u201d in order to protect developers.\n\nApple\u2019s new DMA rules have been widely criticized by developers and tech companies, including Meta, Mozilla and Microsoft. Instead of introducing a new, more level playing field where developers could easily compete with Apple\u2019s App Store, Apple found a way to legally comply with the specifics of the regulation, but not its intention. Most notably, it introduced a Core Technology Fee for those developers adopting its DMA rules, which requires apps distributed outside the App Store to still pay Apple \u20ac0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold. This was bad news for would-be rivals that had wanted to set up their own app stores or distribute their apps outside of Apple\u2019s walls to avoid paying commissions.\n\nIn the new letter, 34 companies and associations across a variety of sectors are asking the EC to take action.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s new terms not only disregard both the spirit and letter of the law, but if left unchanged, make a mockery of the DMA and the considerable efforts by the European Commission and EU institutions to make digital markets competitive,\u201d it reads.\n\nThe letter goes on to point out where the companies think that Apple is non-compliant with the DMA, noting that Apple\u2019s system of requiring developers to choose to opt into the DMA terms adds unnecessary complexity and confusion, as both are non-compliant, it says. Plus, because of the new fee structure, and the Core Technology Fee, it\u2019s clear that few will agree to the DMA terms, the companies said. While there has been much vocal criticism of the terms, at least one developer, MacPaw, recently announced it had accessed the terms to distribute its software subscription Setapp in the EU.\n\nThe companies also complain that Apple\u2019s \u201cscare screens,\u201d designed to warn customers of the risks associated with transacting outside Apple\u2019s App Store, will \u201cmislead and degrade the user experience, depriving them of real choice and the benefits of the DMA.\u201d\n\nFinally, the letter argues that for the DMA to be effective, it needs to allow for alternative app stores and sideloading \u2014 the former which the companies say Apple makes difficult and the latter which Apple\u2019s DMA rules don\u2019t even allow for.\n\nApple, meanwhile, also published a whitepaper today that outlines its solutions to address the changes the DMA requires to commissions and payments. Here, it stresses the security and trust customers have with Apple and its emphasis on consumer privacy. In short, its position is that \u201cUsers should not be exposed to physical harm through iOS,\u201d and that all its efforts with regard to DMA compliance are means of reducing any potential harms that users could be exposed to.\n\nThere are hints that Apple may be feeling the pressure, however, as it also today reversed an earlier decision to block progressive web apps from operating normally on devices in the EU. The FT had recently reported that the EC\u2019s ruling focused on competition in the streaming music market will not be in Apple\u2019s favor and will rather extract a \u20ac500 million fine from the iPhone maker. Apple responded to this by sharing details about Spotify\u2019s success on iOS, noting that its app had been installed more than 119 billion times across Apple devices, among other things.\n\nIn response to the companies\u2019 letter, an EC spokesperson told TechCrunch that the six-month deadline for Big Tech gatekeepers, like Apple, was there for a reason.\n\n\u201cOnce the compliance solutions are fully known next week, these need to be properly analyzed both by the Commission and stakeholders, in its completeness and not just based on a few announcements,\u201d they noted, adding that the Commission is looking \u201cvery carefully\u201d at how companies are complying.\n\nOnce it has full enforcement powers, the EC will \u201cnot hesitate to act,\u201d they also said.", "publisher": {"href": "https://techcrunch.com", "title": "TechCrunch"}}, {"title": "Spotify\u2019s new audiobook tier will only save you a dollar over Premium", "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0yqcZUaFgtYFDr7BbChGXEx_qEY=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23951390/STK088_VRG_Illo_N_Barclay_5_spotify.jpg", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x2400/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953861/IMG_0049_2.jpg", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2000x1333/2400x2400/filters:focal(1000x667:1001x668):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25304628/DSC06782_processed.jpg", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23951390/STK088_VRG_Illo_N_Barclay_5_spotify.jpg", "https://news.google.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4375x2916/2400x2400/filters:focal(2188x1458:2189x1459):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25313069/1441734796.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0yqcZUaFgtYFDr7BbChGXEx_qEY=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23951390/STK088_VRG_Illo_N_Barclay_5_spotify.jpg", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x2400/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24974621/STK088_VRG_Illo_N_Barclay_1_spotify.jpeg"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/1/24087550/spotify-audiobook-access-tier-price-ads", "date": "Fri, 01 Mar 2024 16:28:44 GMT", "short_description": "Spotify's new audiobook tier will only save you a dollar over Premium  The VergeSpotify's New Audiobooks Access Tier Gives Booklovers More Listening Options \u2014 Spotify  For the RecordSpotify rolls out an audiobook-only subscription  EngadgetSpotify launches a $9.99/mo standalone audiobooks service for its free users  TechCrunchSpotify adds a paid audiobook option to its free tier  Digital Trends", "text": "Spotify announced a new subscription tier that \u201cgives booklovers more listening options.\u201d But subscribers would only save $1 a month compared to the classic Premium tier.\n\nThe monthly subscription costs $9.99 and includes 15 free listening hours of audiobooks, the same as the classic Premium plan. But $10.99 Premium subscribers get 15 hours of audiobooks, plus ad-free music and podcasts \u2014 whereas the audiobook plan still has ads for music and podcast services. Essentially, audiobook listeners are paying nearly the same amount while getting half the benefits.\n\nThe audiobook plan also doesn\u2019t add any additional perks for readers. If I were a big audiobook person, I\u2019d probably want more than 15 hours a month, for example. But Spotify is capping the listening limit for Premium subscribers and the book lovers option. For $12.99, subscribers can buy 10 extra hours of books if they run out between billing cycles. The new tier almost feels like it\u2019s simply upselling potential subscribers to the regular Premium option, instead of encouraging people who love audiobooks to subscribe for that service.\n\nOne benefit could be Spotify\u2019s library of options. Audible\u2019s basic plan, priced at $7.95 a month, only covers a selection of audiobooks, compared to the 200,000 titles Spotify is opening up. On the other hand, Audible allows for unlimited listening. A higher priced Audible tier at $14.95 includes unlimited listening to the basic plan library, plus one credit a month to purchase any book that you get to keep.\n\nFor months, anger has been brewing in publishing about Spotify\u2019s treatment of audiobooks, especially around compensation. Some publishers like Macmillan told writers that royalty payments will only apply for each full listen of their book, according to Bloomberg \u2014 one person listening to a full 10-hour-long audiobook or two people each listening to five hours, for example. This is different from other models, where authors are paid for purchases of their titles, regardless of how much the listener consumes. Bloomberg notes that different publishing houses may have different terms with Spotify.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.theverge.com", "title": "The Verge"}}, {"title": "All-Time Low: AirPods Pro 2 Get $60 Discount at Amazon", "top_image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/1f4d59ae8f338b3485df60b0b62871830fd17b44/hub/2023/11/11/b308bc69-332f-43e6-8da3-e926ef79c9a6/artboard-7-3.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "images": ["https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/699a37ce860cb162c0e6743c87e9cf03185f6a68/hub/2023/08/22/ee43218a-f9ae-4d3a-8722-0331bd61ccc5/profile.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=96&width=96", "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/6d2e48ba4b3468bf7138c9be3775074b354a523e/hub/2022/11/16/0234efad-5341-4fab-aaac-bd77416ac5f6/airpodspro2.jpg?auto=webp&width=768", "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/025ba115ca05aaba4b6d25727831e8496307ce3f/hub/2022/06/28/c697fea3-2f4e-4b60-acc4-a93952f2bb92/cnet-shopping-image-gallery-16x9-1920x1080-r1-tech-a.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=108&width=196", "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/1f4d59ae8f338b3485df60b0b62871830fd17b44/hub/2023/11/11/b308bc69-332f-43e6-8da3-e926ef79c9a6/artboard-7-3.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "https://www.cnet.com/a/neutron/images/logos/cnet-short.png", "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/156932e793b5f9a18830535ceb711d54b6261b22/hub/2023/11/11/b308bc69-332f-43e6-8da3-e926ef79c9a6/artboard-7-3.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=360&width=640", "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/c80a5793ead815fe4af1447c19c56f3ae4ff0987/hub/2023/08/22/ee43218a-f9ae-4d3a-8722-0331bd61ccc5/profile.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=84&width=84"], "videos": [], "url": "https://www.cnet.com/deals/all-time-low-airpods-pro-2-get-60-discount-amazon/", "date": "Fri, 01 Mar 2024 14:08:00 GMT", "short_description": "All-Time Low: AirPods Pro 2 Get $60 Discount at Amazon  CNETApple headphones are $69 off in every color at Amazon today  SFGATESave $50 Off a Brand New Pair of Apple AirPods Pro  IGNApple AirPods drops to \u2018lowest-ever\u2019 price, no conditions applied  The Times of India'Nothing short of exceptional': The Airpods Pro 2 are 25% off \u2014 snap them up for $199  Yahoo!

Startups and tech companies are building AI agents and ecosystems on top of the systems that can complete boring chores for you: think automatically making calendar bookings and potentially buying products. But as the tools are given more freedom, it also increases the potential ways they can be attacked.\n\nNow, in a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers have created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms\u2014which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. \u201cIt basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn't been seen before,\u201d says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research.\n\nNassi, along with fellow researchers Stav Cohen and Ron Bitton, created the worm, dubbed Morris II, as a nod to the original Morris computer worm that caused chaos across the internet in 1988. In a research paper and website shared exclusively with WIRED, the researchers show how the AI worm can attack a generative AI email assistant to steal data from emails and send spam messages\u2014breaking some security protections in ChatGPT and Gemini in the process.\n\nThe research, which was undertaken in test environments and not against a publicly available email assistant, comes as large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming multimodal, being able to generate images and video as well as text. While generative AI worms haven\u2019t been spotted in the wild yet, multiple researchers say they are a security risk that startups, developers, and tech companies should be concerned about.\n\nMost generative AI systems work by being fed prompts\u2014text instructions that tell the tools to answer a question or create an image. However, these prompts can also be weaponized against the system. Jailbreaks can make a system disregard its safety rules and spew out toxic or hateful content, while prompt injection attacks can give a chatbot secret instructions. For example, an attacker may hide text on a webpage telling an LLM to act as a scammer and ask for your bank details.\n\nTo create the generative AI worm, the researchers turned to a so-called \u201cadversarial self-replicating prompt.\u201d This is a prompt that triggers the generative AI model to output, in its response, another prompt, the researchers say. In short, the AI system is told to produce a set of further instructions in its replies. This is broadly similar to traditional SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks, the researchers say.\n\nTo show how the worm can work, the researchers created an email system that could send and receive messages using generative AI, plugging into ChatGPT, Gemini, and open source LLM, LLaVA. They then found two ways to exploit the system\u2014by using a text-based self-replicating prompt and by embedding a self-replicating prompt within an image file.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.wired.com", "title": "WIRED"}}, {"title": "Windows includes built-in ransomware protection.

Here's how to turn it on  PCWorld", "text": "Ransomware is nasty stuff. This type of malware encrypts files on your PC so that you can\u2019t access them\u2014unless you must pay the attacker to unlock the data. In other words, your files are held hostage until you cough up the demanded ransom.\n\nThe best defense against ransomware is avoiding sites and downloads riddled with it, but you can take other protective measures, too. Modern antivirus software often restrict which apps can change files in folders commonly targeted by ransomware. Microsoft Defender, which is built into Windows, can do this too. (Microsoft changed the name from Windows Defender several years ago, but it\u2019s the same program.) Some antivirus suites also run automatic backups, in case you need to restore your files.\n\nThe catch? Unlike third-party antivirus software, these extra safeguards are not turned on by default in Microsoft Defender. You have to enable them yourself.\n\nHow to turn on ransomware protection in Windows\n\nStep One: Open Windows Security\n\nOpen the Windows Security app on your PC. You can access it in one of several ways:\n\nPress Alt + Spacebar on your keyboard, type in windows security, then hit Enter\n\nOpen your Start Menu and type in windows security, then press Enter\n\nOpen your Settings app, then choose Windows Security in the left pane\n\nStep Two: Find your ransomware settings\n\nIn the Windows Security app, click on Virus & threat protection. Then click Manage ransomware protection at the bottom of the screen.\n\nNext, turn on Controlled folder access. This setting restricts app access to your PC\u2019s default OneDrive, Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music, and Favorites folders. You can also manually add other folders to the list.\n\nNot all apps will be barred from these areas in Windows\u2014Microsoft Office programs are automatically allowed to open and alter files. But if it\u2019s not on Microsoft\u2019s internal list of trusted apps, a program can\u2019t see anything in those folders until explicit permission is granted in Windows Security.\n\nStep three: Make sure you\u2019re logged into OneDrive\n\nLimiting access to files and folders won\u2019t completely protect them. Another important method of defense is to have good backups\u2014which Windows automatically does if you\u2019re logged into OneDrive. (You can either connect a Microsoft account to your whole Windows PC, or just the OneDrive app specifically.)\n\nTo confirm that this protection is on, you can look at Ransomware protection > Ransomware data recovery.\n\nOf course, for the purpose of warding off ransomware\u2019s worst effects, the safest backup of your files is the one you keep offline. You should make one in addition to anything stored in the cloud\u2014if you only have one copy of your data, you\u2019re not properly backed up after all.\n\nShould you turn on ransomware protection in Windows?\n\nSecurity and convenience live on opposite ends of a spectrum, and that\u2019s the case here, too. Controlling folder access in Windows can keep attackers out of your important folders, but it can also be slightly inconvenient. Gamers, for example, may find that access to save files might be blocked by default, as they\u2019re often saved in your Documents folder.\n\nYou can solve this problem with minimal work\u2014add the app to the access list. Or save game files to a different folder on your PC that does not have controlled access to it. (You\u2019ll just have to use third-party software to set up a schedule for regular backups.)\n\nOUr CURRENT PICK FOR BEST ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE Norton 360 Deluxe Read our review Best Prices Today:\n\nProtect your Windows PC from other online threats, too\n\nFor more information about Windows Security (and its different components), you can check out our video overview on YouTube.

PhoneArena", "text": "Earlier today, sources close to SamMobile stated that Samsung may hold its annual Unpacked event to unveil its foldable phones, the Galaxy Z Flip6 and Z Fold6, in early July. Now, a separate source coming straight from South Korea also believes the event will be held in early to mid July.\n\nAlleged Galaxy Z Fold6 render\n\nThe report says the Unpacked event will take place about two weeks earlier than last year, when it was held on July 26. That would give us a target around July 12. This new report also names Paris as the purported location. The company wants to time its launch before the start of the Paris Olympics on July 26 in an effort to focus on the European market this year. The Korean tech giant wants to fill the void left by the retreating Chinese smartphone makers.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold5 and Z Flip5 got their second debut outside of South Korea about two weeks later in San Francisco, USA, so we wonder if there's going to be an earlier event. Supply chain sources believe the final testing of the products will be in April, way before the July launch date, so there's a slim chance for a domestic launch in South Korea like last year.\n\nMoreover, the report claims there won't be any new foldable or rollable form factors from Samsung this year, but didn't cross the Galaxy Ring off the list.", "publisher": {"href": "https://www.gsmarena.com", "title": "GSMArena.com"}}]}
