(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston)\n\nNot every move Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman makes is perfect.\n\nPraise for Roseman is plentiful, but his move for safety Kevin Byard didn't work out well. The Eagles traded for the former Tennessee Titans All-Pro safety in October, and then on Friday they cut him after just 11 games with the team, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe Eagles didn't give up too much to take a shot on Byard, but did send fifth- and sixth-round picks to the Titans, along with safety Terrell Edmunds. And the move was likely always a short-term rental. The Eagles save a little more than $13 million on the cap by cutting Byard, via OverTheCap.com.\n\nIt's just that the Byard move summed up a completely lost season for the Eagles.\n\nByard, a two-time All-Pro with the Titans, was part of an Eagles secondary that was horrible in the second half of the season. The Eagles had a shocking meltdown at the end of the season, losing five of their last six regular-season games and then losing 32-9 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the wild-card round.\n\nThat wasn't Byard's fault, but he didn't have a big impact either. Byard had one interception in his 11 Eagles games. He'll be a free agent entering his age-31 season.\n\nThe Eagles couldn't get much right in the second half of last season. Roseman had been universally praised for a long time for his job building the Eagles. But the Byard move didn't work out as anyone hoped.", "publisher": {"href": "https://sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"title": "Sources: College football leaders nearing adoption of helmet communications", "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I6OvhsZ7NbWA7iNftbh2lA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/7024ee70-d753-11ee-9f57-2dc9c4a1dc7c", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/it/api/res/1.2/0J7Zw_ntBykfVqUXDRai6Q--~A/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7dz00ODtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/ybar/icons/logo_nfl@3x.png.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_sports_en-US_h_p_sports_2.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=2145457445&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fsources-college-football-leaders-nearing-adoption-of-helmet-communications-154508201.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9rcyOvSrOXE3hAHX7xcHxg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIxMDtoPTIxMA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-08/7548b640-3c6f-11ee-b7dd-730c2c6c9cdc", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pFiN2QcJDLIrq5BL.2kgDw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIyNjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/d6cfeca0-6bdc-11eb-9fff-072dbeffa160", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XAGLsQ11Wdvi8MZ68wu8BQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/7024ee70-d753-11ee-9f57-2dc9c4a1dc7c", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I6OvhsZ7NbWA7iNftbh2lA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/7024ee70-d753-11ee-9f57-2dc9c4a1dc7c", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png"], "videos": [], "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/sources-college-football-leaders-nearing-adoption-of-helmet-communications-154508201.html", "date": "Fri, 01 Mar 2024 15:47:04 GMT", "short_description": "Sources: College football leaders nearing adoption of helmet communications  Yahoo Sports", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 With the NFL Scouting Combine playing out just blocks away, college athletics leaders are moving closer to adopting some of their bigger brother\u2019s ideas.\n\nIn a long-expected move, administrators Friday are expected to finalize a recommendation for the adoption of a player-to-coach helmet communications system, the use of tablets on the sideline as well as in the halftime locker room and a two-minute warning in the college game.\n\nAfter two days of debate here this week, the NCAA Rules Committee is scheduled to vote on the changes in a recommendation to the NCAA Division I Council, which often rubber-stamps such decisions.\n\nThe helmet communications system is, perhaps, the most significant technological change in recent college sports history. The concept will mirror the NFL. Only one member of each team can be equipped with a listening device in his helmet, and the device\u2019s capabilities end at the 15-second mark of the play clock \u2014 a mandatory cut-off time that the NFL also uses.\n\nElectronic tablets would be able to be used on the sideline and in the halftime locker room to review in-game video replays.\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nA break at the two-minute mark of each half is expected to also be part of the recommendation, something officials are referring to as a \u201ctwo-minute timeout.\u201d The break will operate in a similar capacity to the NFL\u2019s \u201ctwo-minute warning.\u201d\n\nFor years hesitant to embrace these advancements because of cost-containment issues, college football is poised to adopt the helmet communications nearly 30 years after the NFL began using it and just months after a sign-stealing scandal erupted in Michigan.\n\nWhile the move will not completely eliminate the sideline art of signing in plays, it is expected to greatly reduce it. Texas Tech used the helmet communications system during its bowl game in December.\n\n\u201cThe players loved it,\u201d Cayman Ancell, Tech\u2019s head equipment manager, told Yahoo Sports in a story in December that explored the advancements. \u201cQuarterback loved it. He didn\u2019t have to look at the sideline. He could keep his eyes on the field.\u201d", "publisher": {"href": "https://sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"title": "How the Victor Wembanyama-Chet Holmgren rivalry began", "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eBJbT.jq0qJL7G6.mSQ5EA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/6ee99960-d781-11ee-9bb9-7d46d17f617e", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_sports_en-US_h_p_sports_2.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=2146233484&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fhow-the-victor-wembanyama-chet-holmgren-rivalry-began-144928453.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pFiN2QcJDLIrq5BL.2kgDw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIyNjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/d6cfeca0-6bdc-11eb-9fff-072dbeffa160", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zLfhYTas7Uu010UcYD2Y2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIxMDtoPTIxMA--/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-02%2F0e1bbd60-779a-11eb-9f5d-7962f217e420&compress=1&progressive=1&quality=75&client=hawkeye&signature=b8809b134346164fd0f45b356317dd0bbf4e5f64", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eBJbT.jq0qJL7G6.mSQ5EA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/6ee99960-d781-11ee-9bb9-7d46d17f617e", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OwvdetAu8ftqIlFlmvxXTQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/6ee99960-d781-11ee-9bb9-7d46d17f617e", "https://s.yimg.com/it/api/res/1.2/cY4YbDExMoclb3kFnQLhOw--~A/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7dz00ODtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/ep/cx/blendr/v2/image-nba-png_1679078955570.png.cf.webp"], "videos": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZInzf49yPc?rel=0"], "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/how-the-victor-wembanyama-chet-holmgren-rivalry-began-144928453.html", "date": "Fri, 01 Mar 2024 14:49:28 GMT", "short_description": "How the Victor Wembanyama-Chet Holmgren rivalry began  Yahoo Sports", "text": "The first active NBA seasons for Chet Holmgren and Victor Wembanyama have exceeded all expectations. Thursday night was no different as the two top rookies battled for the third time this season with Wembanyama's Spurs getting the best of Holmgren's Thunder, 132-118. Wembanyama finished with 28 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists and five blocks while Holmgren put up 23 points, seven rebounds, five assists and one block for the No. 2 team in the Western Conference.\n\nEach time they have met this season, it has been high-level basketball and more fuel for a budding NBA rivalry. Both players do things on the court that no other 7-foot-plus player has done at their age.\n\nWembanyama and Holmgren were very familiar with each other's games well before either of them played in the NBA. In July 2021, Holmgren played for Team USA's Under-19 team alongside other future NBA players as the team traveled to Latvia for the FIBA World Cup. Team USA was favored to win and steamrolled through the first half of the tournament, beating each team in pool play by an average of 40 points. Holmgren had 19 blocks in six games while Wembanyama put up a tournament-high 32 blocks prior to the championship game. USA faced France in the gold-medal game, and it would be the first time Wembanyama and Holmgren would square off.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder's Chet Holmgren (7) tangles with the San Antonio Spurs' Victor Wembanyama (1) during the first half Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024, in San Antonio. (AP Photo/Darren Abate)\n\nNBA scouts and fans already had an idea of what kind of player Holmgren was heading into the tournament. At the time, he was the No. 1 prospect coming out of high school and was headed to Gonzaga, a team that was coming off a run to the national championship game, where it lost to Baylor. The hype was only starting to build for the 17-year-old Wembanyama, who was two years younger than every player on Team USA's roster.\n\nThe big stage and intrigue of the two unicorn-like prospects drew a sold-out crowd at Arena Riga that included over 100 NBA executives and scouts. Of course, both Wembanyama and Holmgren met for the tip, and it was Holmgren and Team USA that got off to a hot start with Holmgren scoring five out of the game's first 10 points. France finally settled in and it was a five-point game at halftime. Wembanyama came alive in the second half and was the best prospect on the court, hitting a step-back 3, being creative off the dribble and converting in transition. He was everywhere defensively and finished with an astonishing eight blocks. Holmgren was quiet the entire third quarter and finally drew a spark in the fourth, when France was up 68-64. Holmgren scored five straight points and led an 11-0 run for USA. Wembanyama hit some foul trouble and exited the game late in the fourth quarter after Team USA's Jaden Ivey drew contact in the lane. USA closed it out in the final minute, 83-81, taking home the gold.\n\nHolmgren was named tournament MVP and finished the game with 10 points, five assists and two rebounds. A visibly upset Wembanyama led all players in the championship game with 22 points and recorded eight rebounds. Both players were named to the All-Tournament team along with Ivey, Purdue's Zach Edey and the Miami Heat's Nikola Jovic. Both players posed for pictures, a few words were exchanged and a rivalry was born.\n\nLet\u2019s re-visit how ridiculous the FIBA U19 World Cup All-Tournament Team / Suicide Squad was.\n\n\n\nNikola Jovi\u0107 - Serbia\n\nZach Edey - Canada\n\nVictor Wembanyama - France\n\nJaden Ivey - United States\n\nChet Holmgren - United States (MVP) pic.twitter.com/pZvcaBkDH3 \u2014 Matt Pennie (@matt_pennie) January 31, 2022\n\nEven though both players were in different draft classes, with Holmgren missing the 2022-23 season with a foot injury, they will be linked together for as long as they're in the NBA. Their combination of size, shot blocking and the way they can both take players off the dribble and knock down 3s is incredible. There's something very unique and special when both Holmgren and Wembanyama square off, and the first three rounds this season have delivered.\n\nThe NBA eagerly awaited the first time Wembanyama and Holmgren shared the court in the regular season. Holmgren and the Thunder got the best of Wembanyama in that first game, but the matchups have continued to bring out the best and most competitive sides of both players.\n\nIt is truly a sight to behold.", "publisher": {"href": "https://sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"title": "NFL combine: 40-yard dash, TE and DB workouts, latest news and more", "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9tw2nybYjbfz9ASOO6wusg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/eb0b10a0-d7fe-11ee-9e31-79a93f104c3a", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/it/api/res/1.2/0J7Zw_ntBykfVqUXDRai6Q--~A/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7dz00ODtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/ybar/icons/logo_nfl@3x.png.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_sports_en-US_h_p_sports_2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9tw2nybYjbfz9ASOO6wusg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/eb0b10a0-d7fe-11ee-9e31-79a93f104c3a", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oNA8Z7pf2e7An4mBfWPzkw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/f699b530-d753-11ee-bfdb-f7a2facea1e7", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lJMGrKltdjagzJjpA2JOaQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/bd322340-d771-11ee-b77e-54ba2bc4bdb4", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pFiN2QcJDLIrq5BL.2kgDw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIyNjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/d6cfeca0-6bdc-11eb-9fff-072dbeffa160", "https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/d2f4cb00-e600-11ed-b55f-6817177f4c26", "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2023-01%2F992e7bc0-a058-11ed-a6ff-a2656c80c332&compress=1&progressive=1&quality=75&client=hawkeye&signature=27d9e3dda8a182d6769762185aa479dfdb990d5e", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/89700780-e45f-11ed-bf59-1c8ed530ac0a", "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fimage_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fs.yimg.com%252Fos%252Fcreatr-uploaded-images%252F2023-01%252F4204b040-8bad-11ed-abff-35beafc4d30a%26compress%3D1%26progressive%3D1%26quality%3D75%26client%3Dhawkeye%26signature%3D705a042cd06ab8331b6ee0823cbadd4bca386380&compress=1&progressive=1&quality=75&client=hawkeye&signature=84d5d35768429fd7496170a7a32a1a85146129ea", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=2145457445&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fnfl-combine-40-yard-dash-te-and-db-workouts-latest-news-and-more-190734739.html&c14=-1"], "videos": [], "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl-combine-40-yard-dash-te-and-db-workouts-latest-news-and-more-190734739.html", "date": "Fri, 01 Mar 2024 19:57:01 GMT", "short_description": "NFL combine: 40-yard dash, TE and DB workouts, latest news and more  Yahoo Sports", "text": "The 2024 NFL scouting combine is well underway in Indianapolis as workouts began Thursday and continue through the weekend.\n\nOn Friday, the defensive backs and tight ends will take the field for workouts.

Fisker also said it would reduce its headcount by 15%.\n\nFisker said it had $396 million in cash at the end of Q4, though $70 million of that is restricted. Fisker said it is in talks with a current noteholder about making an additional investment in the company and that it's negotiating with \u201ca large automaker for a potential transaction which could include an investment in Fisker, joint development of one or more electric vehicle platforms, and North America manufacturing.\u201d\n\nThe Fisker Ocean, the new all-electric SUV from the American automaker, exhibited at Mobile World Congress (MWC) the biggest trade show of the sector focused on mobile devices, 5G, IOT, AI and big data, celebrated in Barcelona, on March 3, 2022, in Barcelona, Spain. (Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWhile talks of a cash infusion and strategic partnership with an established automaker are welcome news, it wasn\u2019t enough to end doubts of Fisker\u2019s precarious condition. Shares of the EV maker tumbled over 40% in early trade, with shares now stuck below $1 since early January.\n\nCiti analyst Itay Michaeli generally feels Fisker\u2019s lone product, the Ocean EV, holds promise and isn\u2019t surprised that a large automaker is interested in investing in Fisker, but this isn\u2019t enough for him to keep the faith in Fisker.\n\n\u201cSecuring such an agreement would likely serve as a major positive for Fisker, but it\u2019s hard to underpin an investment thesis entirely on this, and we would\u2019ve liked to have seen more progress on this front by now,\u201d Michaeli wrote in a note to investors. Michaeli downgraded the stock to Neutral/High Risk (equivalent of a Hold) and cut his price target to $.80 from $4.\n\nIn Q4, Fisker reported revenue of $200.1 million, missing Bloomberg consensus estimates for $272.9 million, and a net loss of $463.6 million, much wider than the $82.7 million loss expected.\n\n\u201c2023 was a challenging year for Fisker, including delays with suppliers and other issues that prevented us from delivering the Ocean SUV as quickly as we had expected,\u201d chairman and CEO Henrik Fisker said. \u201cThere were a number of unanticipated challenges, including rising interest rates, finding enough skilled labor, and identifying appropriate real estate locations to make the DTC model function effectively.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nFisker CEO Henrik Fisker introduces the all-electric off-road Ocean called the Force E during its inaugural \"Product Vision Day\" in Huntington Beach, Calif., on Aug. 3, 2023.

BROWN via Getty Images)\n\nFisker\u2019s challenges in setting up its direct-to-consumer model led the company to seek out traditional dealer partnerships, with the company revealing it now has 12 dealer partners on hand and over 250 dealers interested.\n\nWhile talk of new partnerships and a dealer sales network is promising, the main concern for investors is Fisker\u2019s lack of cash.\n\n\u201cIf the company had ample liquidity through 2025, then risk/reward would arguably be interesting here with the stock having come under significant pressure,\u201d Michaeli wrote. \u201cBut with the liquidity runway narrowing and accounting/reporting issues still unresolved, it\u2019s hard to make an investment case here with such poor [near-term] visibility.\u201d\n\nProgramming note: Be sure to watch Fisker chairman and CEO Henrik Fisker live on Yahoo Finance today at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But a big question around the game of baseball right now is, What happens to Boras's other clients, Jordan Montgomery, Blake Snell, Matt Chapman? And let's not forget JD Martinez who had a really solid season for the Los Angeles Dodgers last year.\n\nNow, Bellinger has the advantage of being 28-years-old and probably helped to his advantage to get those opt-outs after both year 1 and year 2. But for some of Boras's other clients, they might not have that same advantage. Matt Chapman is 30-years-old. Blake Snell and Jordan Montgomery are 31, and JD Martinez is 36. So do some of Boras's other clients have to sign one-year deals or will a team throw an opt-out in there to potentially get his clients back into the market next year? So it'll be really interesting to see how teams and Boras go about their business with the season right around the corner.\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]", "publisher": {"href": "https://sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"title": "Giants will bring back Darren Waller after tight end reportedly considered retirement", "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8WLXyS4Hhx8Jn89dO2_xLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/ee2da700-d7f6-11ee-a45f-7e9c764b6c91", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=2145457445&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fgiants-will-bring-back-darren-waller-after-tight-end-reportedly-considered-retirement-183437293.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/it/api/res/1.2/0J7Zw_ntBykfVqUXDRai6Q--~A/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7dz00ODtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/ybar/icons/logo_nfl@3x.png.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_sports_en-US_h_p_sports_2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sIK422ndGUo.Ma4Ldpe_qQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e319b420-d806-11ee-bdfd-bb1cfed7d9fe", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pFiN2QcJDLIrq5BL.2kgDw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIyNjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/d6cfeca0-6bdc-11eb-9fff-072dbeffa160", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Tqf2hTIZWYBdz.4V8Twz6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIxMDtoPTIxMA--/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2023-10%2F827177e0-6018-11ee-9fef-22290ba0faa2&compress=1&progressive=1&quality=75&client=hawkeye&signature=99783e485f0eccbf7030fb851482377b994b62a1", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8WLXyS4Hhx8Jn89dO2_xLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/ee2da700-d7f6-11ee-a45f-7e9c764b6c91"], "videos": [], "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/giants-will-bring-back-darren-waller-after-tight-end-reportedly-considered-retirement-183437293.html", "date": "Fri, 01 Mar 2024 18:34:37 GMT", "short_description": "Giants will bring back Darren Waller after tight end reportedly considered retirement  Yahoo Sports", "text": "The 31-year-old Waller has missed 19 games over the past three seasons\n\nDarren Waller sounded optimistic about the 2024 Giants. (Photo by Cooper Neill/Getty Images)\n\nDarren Waller will return for a second season with the New York Giants after reportedly contemplating retirement following a disappointing 2023 campaign.\n\nWaller, 31, missed four games due to injury in 2023 and has been unable to stay healthy on a regular basis since the 2020 season when he was with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nIn 12 games during his first season with the Giants, Waller caught 52 passes for 552 yards and a touchdown. His lack of production and injury issues had him thinking about hanging up his cleats, according to the New York Post.\n\nIt seemed as if the 31-year-old tight end might have thought it was time to bid adieu to the NFL. Last year, Waller released his second rap album, \u201cWalking Miracle.\u2019\u2019\n\n...\n\nWith the Giants, Waller could not rise above the dysfunction on the offensive line and the revolving door at quarterback.\n\nThe Giants acquired Waller in a March 2023 trade in exchange for a draft pick. His contract runs through the 2026 season after signing a $51 million extension in 2022.\n\nFor the 2024 season, Waller will make a base salary of $10.5 million and carry a $14 million salary-cap hit, according to OverTheCap.com. (That cap hit jumps to $15.4 million in 2025 and $17.4 million in 2026.) There is no guaranteed money remaining on his contract, which is why he was a candidate to be cut this offseason.\n\nWhen healthy, Waller has shown he can be a major factor on offense. During his two best NFL seasons with the Raiders \u2014 2019 and 2020 \u2014 he recorded a combined 197 receptions, 2,341 yards and 12 touchdowns. But since 2020, he has missed 19 games due to injury.\n\nWaller vowed in December to use the offseason to find a way to stay on the field more regularly.

I think that's just in life regardless of what you do.\"\n\nKhan passed on answering any questions about whether that competition may come from a trade for available quarterbacks like the Chicago Bears' Justin Fields or the Denver Broncos' Russell Wilson.\n\n\"I'm not going to go into details about the conversations that we've had,\" Khan said, \"but I can tell you that I have an obligation to look at every avenue that's out there to try to make us a better football team.\"\n\nMitchell Tribusky was released and Rudolph currently isn't under contract, although he helped his case to return, thanks to leading the Steelers' offense to back-to-back, 30-plus-point games.\n\nRudolph may represent one competitor, as Khan said the team would like to retain him.\n\n\"We've been in communication with his representative,\" Khan said, \"and he knows we want him back.\"", "publisher": {"href": "https://sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"title": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto's got the stuff, Shohei Ohtani got married & why aren't all spring training games televised?", "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GS.jpCKXR_RnXCHBKumn_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/207edbb0-d7f8-11ee-9f5f-6bc2b6f2aaa3", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CMjWNX8KjVPwmWI8z5Lxig--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIxMDtoPTIxMA--/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fimage_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fs.yimg.com%252Fos%252Fcreatr-uploaded-images%252F2024-02%252F3f12e160-cad9-11ee-bbff-c02d8ce8aa8b%26compress%3D1%26progressive%3D1%26quality%3D75%26client%3Dhawkeye%26signature%3D52bde122f14db2680183597ce49a4b29b6829757&compress=1&progressive=1&quality=75&client=hawkeye&signature=92217dabebe8e71c2fbb6624b59422457475db8d", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_sports_en-US_h_p_sports_2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GS.jpCKXR_RnXCHBKumn_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/207edbb0-d7f8-11ee-9f5f-6bc2b6f2aaa3", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PiDqVNH0r4obeAPn0NZ_zg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/207edbb0-d7f8-11ee-9f5f-6bc2b6f2aaa3", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pFiN2QcJDLIrq5BL.2kgDw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIyNjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/d6cfeca0-6bdc-11eb-9fff-072dbeffa160", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=2143969772&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fyoshinobu-yamamotos-got-the-stuff-shohei-ohtani-got-married--why-arent-all-spring-training-games-televised-182500202.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/it/api/res/1.2/LkCxlqs4yHsTH.DYxoCpOg--~A/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7dz00ODtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/ep/cx/blendr/v2/image-mlb-png_1679355670001.png.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rkPzw8EsJrcQ7BYNtqszAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIxMDtoPTIxMA--/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fimage_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fs.yimg.com%252Fos%252Fcreatr-uploaded-images%252F2024-02%252F6b6a3a40-cad6-11ee-97c3-0c2ed08dca90%26compress%3D1%26progressive%3D1%26quality%3D75%26client%3Dhawkeye%26signature%3Df9d216fb4135375fca826619f4a2b8fb464b1160&compress=1&progressive=1&quality=75&client=hawkeye&signature=008c7ff526ffc45881aecec303a5f5f68e6e375e"], "videos": [], "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/yoshinobu-yamamotos-got-the-stuff-shohei-ohtani-got-married--why-arent-all-spring-training-games-televised-182500202.html", "date": "Fri, 01 Mar 2024 18:25:00 GMT", "short_description": "MLB Podcast: Yamamoto's got the stuff & Ohtani got married  Yahoo Sports", "text": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto's got the stuff, Shohei Ohtani got married & why aren't all spring training games televised?\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nSubscribe to Baseball Bar-B-Cast\n\nShohei Ohtani isn't the only new player in Dodger blue this offseason making waves. Jake Mintz & Jordan Shusterman kick off this episode reacting to Yoshinobu Yamamoto's first start in spring training, as he threw two scoreless innings against the Texas Rangers and looks exactly as advertised in terms of being an electric addition to the Los Angeles Dodgers starting rotation.\n\nLooking at the Dodgers' NorCal rivals, the guys also respond to Jung Hoo Lee's first homer of spring training and discuss why the San Francisco Giants could be sneakily watchable this season, if not outright good.\n\nJordan then dives into his frustration around spring training broadcasts and why so many games from March are unavailable to be viewed outside of a few highlights here or there. In a sport that's been desperate to make fans more aware of its teams and stars, and in a time where anything is possible technologically, why limit how many games fans can see?\n\nAfter the break, the guys dive into what everyone really came here for: Shohei Ohtani's surprise marriage announcement. Jake & Jordan dive into Ohtani's massive privacy in comparison to other stars & try to determine how secret of a wedding the Dodgers star actually had.\n\nWrapping up the show, the crew discusses a picture circulating around the internet of St. Louis Cardinals legend Yadier Molina wearing Cubs gear, a strange baseball-themed tweet from the Vegas Golden Knights & Jordan's visit with Ken Griffey Jr., who has taken up wildlife photography in his retirement years.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto made his impressive spring training and debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers this week against the Texas Rangers, throwing two scoreless innings.

He filled up the box score and put his versatile skills on display as he helped ice the game with a pair of deep 3-pointers down the stretch.\n\n[Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for the 2024 MLB season]\n\nWith San Antonio leading 119-13 with 3:30 remaining, Wembanyama pulled up from 28 feet to extend the Spurs' lead to 122-113.\n\nVictor Wembanyama from WAY DOWNTOWN \ud83d\ude31\n\n\n\nSpurs lead the Thunder 122-113 with 3:23 remaining \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/6Y41rt5AyF \u2014 ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) March 1, 2024\n\nTwo possessions later, Wembanyama faced up Holmgren from the top of the key, then passed the ball to a cutting Devin Vassell.

The 3s from the 7-foot-4 phenom punctuated a late Spurs surge that helped San Antonio turn a 105-103 deficit into a 14-point win over the second-place team in the Western Conference.\n\nWembanyama paced the Spurs with 28 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and five blocks. He shot 9 of 17 from the field including a remarkable 5-of-7 effort from 3-point distance.\n\nWEMBY VS. CHET\n\n\n\nBOX OFFICE \ud83c\udfac pic.twitter.com/i18ET3MRuk \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) March 1, 2024\n\nHolmgren countered with 23 points, seven rebounds, five assists and one block. He couldn't match Wembanyama from long distance on a 1-of-4 night from beyond the arc. His one make from long distance was an early tone-setter in transition over Wembanyama after he pushed the ball up court from the opposing baseline.\n\nUltimately, Wembanyama came out the clear victor of Thursday's battle of the 7-foot Rookie of the Year hopefuls.\n\nWembanyama had plenty of help as the Spurs picked up their 12th win of the season to improve to 12-48. Vassell matched him with 28 points alongside nine assists and two steals. Jeremy Sochan added 21 points and 10 rebounds, while Tre Jones tallied 17 points, eight assists and six rebounds. All four hit three or more 3-pointers while shooting 50% or better from long distance. As a team, the Spurs shot 19 of 39 (48.7%) from 3-point distance on a 52.7% shooting night overall.\n\nThunder All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led all scorers with 31 points alongside six rebounds and three assists. Jalen Williams added 26 points, six rebounds and three assists. But Oklahoma City couldn't keep up from long distance on a 9-of-31 (29%) shooting night from beyond the 3-point line. The Thunder dropped to 41-18, a full game behind the first-place Minnesota Timberwolves in the West.\n\nWith the Spurs well out of playoff contention, there will be only one more chance this season for Holmgren and Wembanyama to square off. The Spurs and Thunder meet for the fourth and final time on April 10 in Oklahoma City.", "publisher": {"href": "https://sports.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}}]}
